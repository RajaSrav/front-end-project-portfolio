        <p>The cucumber is a creeping vine that roots in the ground and grows up trellises or other supporting frames, wrapping around supports with thin, spiraling tendrils. The plant may also root in a soilless medium and will sprawl along the
          ground if it does not have supports. The vine has large leaves that form a canopy over the fruits.</p>
